Born and raised in Los Angeles, I've always had a knack for technology. As I grew up, I was introduced to the world of software engineering, and I fell in love with what I saw. 

Iâ€™ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has been considered elementary to many, I've never let that get in my way of enjoying my passion to build software and solve problems.

Besides making software, I enjoy playing Rainbow 6: Seige, working out, and reading.
